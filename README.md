9. Matlab scripts staring with Letter "CFxxx.." has been used for Cardiac Signature/ Cardiac Fingerprint discovery and training for Human Iddentification and Gender Knowledge Analysis with Human vs Pet Classification

10. "Prediction" Matlab script does human identification based on training thresholds. Also it has the ground truths with which at end it automatically generates the Confusion Matrix of Novel Human Identification System.

11. "Visualization" Matlab script generates scatterplots for analysis and threshold determination of Training stages of different Cardiac Signatures/Cardiac Fingerprints

12. "SignRank_TestAnalysis" Matlab script uses Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test to check whether discovered Cardiac Signatures/Cardiac Fingerprints are influenced by other Human Physiological Parameters like Age, Height, Weight and BMI. Additionally it also does study on Mean, Median and Standard Deviation.

13. "Autocorrl_calc" and "Ps_w_norm_calc" Matlab scripts studies autocorrelation of Heart Sounds and Power Spectrum of Radar Chest Displacement Signal respectively.
